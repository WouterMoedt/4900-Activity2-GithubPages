## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/WouterMoedt/WouterMoedt.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/WouterMoedt/WouterMoedt.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

## About this website

<img src="WM.jpg">



Hello and welcome to my website!

This website provides an overview of the four different universities I have studied at so far. Each of the links above will let you navigate to a page about the selected university, which will include some general information about the university, as well as an image of the university. This website does not have the intention to serve as a resume, but simply provides a bit of information on each university.

Under "Time Periods" you will find a table which lists from when to when I have attended each university.
Finally, on the "Contact" page you will find my contact details, as well as links to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.
