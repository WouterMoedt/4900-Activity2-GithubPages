## About this website

<center><img src="WM.jpg"></center>



Hello and welcome to my website!

This website provides an overview of the four different universities I have studied at so far. Each of the links above will let you navigate to a page about the selected university, which will include some general information about the university, as well as an image of the university. This website does not have the intention to serve as a resume, but simply provides a bit of information on each university.

Under "Time Periods" you will find a table which lists from when to when I have attended each university.
Finally, on the "Contact" page you will find my contact details, as well as links to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.
