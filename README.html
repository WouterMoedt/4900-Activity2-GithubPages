    <b># Purpose #</b> <br />
    The purpose of this personal website is to display the different universities I, Wouter Moedt, have attended.<br />
    The website should show visitors the time periods I have spent at each university, and provide some basic information about each university.<br />
    The website should also show at least one photo of each university.<br />
    In addition, a contact page should provide links to LinkedIn / GitHub, as well as contact information (email and phone).
    <br />
    <br />
    <b># Design #</b><br />
    This basic website has been created with HTML and CSS. The folder contains one CSS file, and each page is created in an individual HTML file.<br />
    The folder also contains a dedicated folder to save images locally.
    <br />
    <br />
    The CSS file includes the design for the header, body, navigation and table.<br />
    When changes are to be made to the overall design of the website, changes should be made in the CSS file to ensure the design remains consistent on each page.<br />
    hen changes are to made to the content (text, images, tables etc.) of a page, this should be done in the dedicated HTML file of the page.
